## 🧠 AI Dispute Resolution

### ⚡ Resolution Process

1. **Automatic Activation**: Dispute triggers AI analysis
2. **Data Collection**: AI gathers all relevant evidence
3. **Analysis Phase**: Advanced algorithms evaluate the case
4. **Confidence Scoring**: AI assigns confidence level to its decision
5. **Resolution or Escalation**: High confidence = automatic resolution, low confidence = human review
