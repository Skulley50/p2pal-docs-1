# ðŸ’¸ Revenue Sharing

*'"Owned by the people, for the people."'*

P2PAL is not just a platform â€” it's an opportunity to own a real stake in the ecosystem you help build. As a fully community-owned protocol, 100% of all platform revenue is distributed directly to token holders. There are no hidden cuts â€” no VC control, no middlemen â€” just transparent, automated, on-chain revenue sharing.

## ðŸ“Š How Revenue Is Shared

Revenue is distributed proportionally based on the percentage of **P2PAL tokens you hold relative to the circulating supply.** Non-circulating tokens (locked, vested, treasury, or otherwise restricted) are excluded and do not receive distributions. The more tokens you hold, the larger your share of the revenue.

### Example:
If the total supply is 10,000,000 tokens but only 8,000,000 are in circulation, and you hold 160,000 (2% of circulating supply), you will receive **2% of total platform revenue** for that distribution period.

## ðŸ’° Revenue Share Breakdown

Based on our updated scenario of **$383,438 annual platform revenue**, here's how different token ownership percentages translate to annual payouts:

| % of Token Supply Owned | Your Share of Revenue | Annual Payout (USDT) |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0.1%                   | 0.1%                 | $383                |
| 0.5%                   | 0.5%                 | $1,917              |
| 1%                     | 1%                   | $3,834              |
| 2%                     | 2%                   | $7,669              |
| 5%                     | 5%                   | $19,172             |
