### 🛠️ How It Works:

- When a job begins, funds are locked in a **smart escrow contract**.
- The freelancer completes the task, and once approved, funds are released after a '7 Day Grace Period'.
- If there's a dispute, our **AI Dispute Resolver** steps in to evaluate the conversation and work.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Dispute Resolution:

- Our proprietary AI reviews all evidence, communication, and files.
- It makes a fair judgment based on context and clarity.
- If the **confidence score** is low, the case is **escalated for human review** to ensure fairness.

### 🔐 Security Features:

- **Smart Contract Protection**: Funds are secured on the blockchain
- **Automated Release**: Payments are released automatically when conditions are met
- **Dispute Protection**: Both parties are protected against unfair practices
- **Transparent Process**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain

### 💰 Refund Process:

1. **Automatic Refunds**: If project terms aren't met, refunds are processed automatically
2. **Grace Period**: 7-day window for final reviews and adjustments
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Fair resolution through AI analysis
4. **Human Oversight**: Complex cases reviewed by human arbitrators

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Peace of Mind**: Your funds are always protected
- **Fair Outcomes**: AI ensures unbiased dispute resolution
- **Fast Resolution**: Most disputes resolved within 24-48 hours
- **Transparent Fees**: All costs are clearly stated upfront
